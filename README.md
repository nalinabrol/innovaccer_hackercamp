Desktop_Clean.py will move all the files from your destop to a folder of your choice where it will be saved in a sub-folder based on the 
extention of the file.
It will not move the shortcuts on the desktop.
The user just need to input the operating system, the path of the desktop and the path of the location where it wants to shift the files.
A sample path will be shown to the user



top10files.py will show the top 10 files on the user's system with their size in human readable format. The user just need to specify 
the operating system.


NOTE:- Both the scripts work strictly for Python 3 and above.
